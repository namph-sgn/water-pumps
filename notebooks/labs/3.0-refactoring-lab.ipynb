valid string path is acceptable. The string could be a URL. Valid\n","    URL schemes include http, ftp, s3, gs, and file. For file URLs, a host is\n","    expected. A local file could be: file://localhost/path/to/table.csv.\n","\n","    If you want to pass in a path object, pandas accepts any ``os.PathLike``.\n","\n","    By file-like object, we refer to objects with a ``read()`` method, such as\n","    a file handle (e.g. via builtin ``open`` function) or ``StringIO``.\n","sep : str, default ','\n","    Delimiter to use. If sep is None, the C engine cannot automatically detect\n","    the separator, but the Python parsing engine can, meaning the latter will\n","    be used and automatically detect the separator by Python's builtin sniffer\n","    tool, ``csv.Sniffer``. In addition, separators longer than 1 character and\n","    different from ``'\\s+'`` will be interpreted as regular expressions and\n","    will also force the use of the Python parsing engine. Note that regex\n","    delimiters are prone to ignoring quoted data. Regex example: ``'\\r\\t'``.\n","delimiter : str, default ``None``\n","    Alias for sep.\n","header : int, list of int, default 'infer'\n","    Row number(s) to use as the column names, and the start of the\n","    data.  Default behavior is to infer the column names: if no names\n","    are passed the behavior is identical to ``header=0`` and column\n","    names are inferred from the first line of the file, if column\n","    names are passed explicitly then the behavior is identical to\n","    ``header=None``. Explicitly pass ``header=0`` to be able to\n","    replace existing names. The header can be a list of integers that\n","    specify row locations for a multi-index on the columns\n","    e.g. [0,1,3]. Intervening rows that are not specified will be\n","    skipped (e.g. 2 in this example is skipped). Note that this\n","    parameter ignores commented lines and empty lines if\n","    ``skip_blank_lines=True``, so ``header=0`` denotes the first line of\n","    data rather than the first line of the file.\n","names : array-like, optional\n","    List of column names to use.

For example, a valid list-like\n","    `usecols` parameter would be ``[0, 1, 2]`` or ``['foo', 'bar', 'baz']``.\n","    Element order is ignored, so ``usecols=[0, 1]`` is the same as ``[1, 0]``.\n","    To instantiate a DataFrame from ``data`` with element order preserved use\n","    ``pd.read_csv(data, usecols=['foo', 'bar'])[['foo', 'bar']]`` for columns\n","    in ``['foo', 'bar']`` order or\n","    ``pd.read_csv(data, usecols=['foo', 'bar'])[['bar', 'foo']]``\n","    for ``['bar', 'foo']`` order.\n","\n","    If callable, the callable function will be evaluated against the column\n","    names, returning names where the callable function evaluates to True.
